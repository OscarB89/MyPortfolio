# Week 7

## Weekly Goals https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/further_javascript

1. I can build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
2. I can request and use data from an external API.
3. I can explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Notes/News/Chitter challenges to improve understanding.

#### Evidence:

1. Built single-page using front-end JS only, no JQuery. https://github.com/bateso88/notes-app

## Daily Goals

#### Monday
- GOAL: Create own testing library to TDD front-end JS
- PLAN: Develop as simple-as-possible syntax to evaluate boolean and give visibility
- EVIDENCE: https://github.com/bateso88/notes-app/blob/main/spec/TestingFramework.js

#### Tuesday
- GOAL: Reinforce understanding of module pattern
- PLAN: Use module pattern in Notes App and do lots of console.logging!
- EVIDENCE: In the [Notes App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk7-notesapp) I started to create whole constructor functions within modules, exporting them so that functions/variables within the module & outside of the constructor were kept 'private'.
