# Week 7

## Weekly Goals

1. I can build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
2. I can request and use data from an external API.
3. I can explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Notes/News/Chitter challenges to improve understanding.

#### Evidence:

1. Built single-page [Notes App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk7-notesapp) using front-end JS only, no JQuery.

## Daily Goals

#### Monday
- GOAL: Improve understanding of JS obj/prototype framework
- PLAN: Work through JS Objects and Prototypes Practical
- EVIDENCE: Completed these [here](https://hackmd.io/nb1VZarCTGicD6dMOo43Ww), and read up online.

#### Tuesday
- GOAL: Reinforce understanding of module pattern
- PLAN: Use module pattern in Notes App and do lots of console.logging!
- EVIDENCE: In the [Notes App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk7-notesapp) I started to create whole constructor functions within modules, exporting them so that functions/variables within the module & outside of the constructor were kept 'private'.

#### Wednesday
- GOAL: Create own testing library to TDD front-end JS
- PLAN: Develop as simple-as-possible syntax to evaluate boolean and give visibility
- EVIDENCE: Created in [News App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/news-summary-challenge/blob/master/FrontEndJavaOption/tests/testing-library.js) and to a lesser extent, the [Notes App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk7-notesapp/tree/master/test)
