# Week 3

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
4. Explain the MVC pattern

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web) to create my own webapp.
2. Follow debugging practical to debug simple web app
3. Read up on basics of web design, draw flow charts to ensure my understanding is complete
4. Use Battle/RPS project to reinforce understanding of MVC pattern.

#### Evidence:

1.

  - [Completed Battle App!](https://github.com/DanGyi23/battle_game)
  - [Completed Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard app!](https://github.com/DanGyi23/rps-challenge) - slightly more complicated app with more attention paid to the layout/HTML on the views.
2. [Debugging practical completed](https://github.com/DanGyi23/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/debugging_2)
3. Effectively implemented GET/POST methods using sinatra/shotgun for all of this weeks tasks. Understand that when you visit a page you send a GET request, which retrieves any HTML with associated CSS styling that is defined as part of that view.
4. Split Battle project into lib/spec/views folders and keep separate. [Repo here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk3-battle). The model here are Ruby classes that are being called by the controller (app.rb), which defines what happens on each page of the web app. The view is the files contained in the views folder, containing what is displayed in the browser when it's called.

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

Yes, although if I had more time, I'd have spent it learning more HTML/CSS, and improving the look of my web apps. I do feel like I understand how the process works though.

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

Spend a bit more time understanding theory behind some of the dependencies we're using each week. Might be a bit superfluous though, and I feel like I'm spending/rationing my time well at the moment.
