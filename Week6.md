## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Yes, I was really pleased with the App, despite only having a few of us working on it. I spent a lot of time getting SQL errors because of large DB demands, which meant timeouts were frequent in the browser. I wanted to challenge myself to build a really nice front-end with JQuery and CSS/HTML, and that worked brilliantly. It was responsive too!
- If we'd have had a larger team, we'd likely have managed to build a lot more features, but for the time we had, the 'product' was really excellent.
- I really, really enjoyed working in a team on a single project, rather than in pairs for the afternoon.

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

**Personal:**
- Try not to finish everything - there's too much to complete and my learning was compromised at times by being too concerned with completion rather than the process
- Spend more time understanding a problem/feature before starting to write code. I found that it meant I had to refactor less, and interdependencies were easier to map out
