# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn some basic TDD best practices **✓**
2. Debug some programs with errors - follow best practices **✓**
3. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP **✓**
4. Pair using the driver-navigator style **✓**

#### Plans to achieve:
1. Work through the Boris Bike Challenge and attend workshop
2. Debug Ruby programs that have multiple syntax and testing errors
3. Work through OO exercises in the course week outline
4. Each afternoon work for 3 hours with different paired partners, and follow best practices to maintain collaborative repos.

#### Evidence:
1. 
- **Boris-Bikes** Exhaustive step-wise Boris Bike challenge [here](https://github.com/DanGyi23/boris_bike_challenge) - commits demonstrate different stages of unit & feature testing. Completed as part of a pair.
  - **Airport Challenge**

## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


- Yes, I feel far more confident with OOP particularly, which was an area of weakness I focused on to address. 
- My TDD practices improved dramatically, and it was obvious that when creating large complex programs with multiple user demands, TDD will save so much time and improve code quality. 
- I feel very confident using Rspec to debug programs, having completed all of the debugging practicals available for week1. 
- I thoroughly enjoyed pair programming, and received some great feedback; I'm happy with the process improvement over the week, although I'll keep requesting feedback in order to improve!


### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*


**Technical:**
- I'd love to improve my understanding of more Ruby syntax, in order to write code quicker
- I often received syntax errors during testing due to rushing to write code, so taking more care is something I'll be more aware of moving forward
- I'd consider some of the structures for shared classes that could be incorporated into modules, I found this really great for refactoring and it's something I wish I'd known at the start of the week!

**Personal:**
- I'd be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
- I'd make sure to agree with my pairing partner how frequently we'd switch between driver/navigator, to avoid unequal pairing
