# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn some basic TDD best practices
2. Debug some programs with errors - follow best practices
3. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
4. Pair using the driver-navigator style

#### Plans to achieve:
1. Work through the Boris Bike Challenge and attend workshop
2. Debug Ruby programs that have multiple syntax and testing errors
3. Work through OO exercises in the course week outline
4. Each afternoon work for 3 hours with different paired partners, and follow best practices to maintain collaborative repos.

#### Evidence:
- **Boris-Bikes** Exhaustive step-wise Boris Bike challenge (https://github.com/OscarB89/boris_bikes) - commits demonstrate different stages of unit & feature testing. Completed as part of a pair.
- **Airport Challenge** (https://github.com/OscarB89/airport_challenge)

## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


- Yes, I feel far more confident with OOP particularly
- My TDD practices improved
- I feel confident using Rspec to debug programs 
- I thoroughly enjoyed pair programming, and received some great feedback


### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*


**Technical:**
- I'd love to improve my understanding of more Ruby/RSpec syntax

**Personal:**
- I'd be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
- I'd make sure to agree with my pairing partner how frequently we'd switch between driver/navigator
